#### Waves

Waves are applied to all buttons if you configure the bridge with `useAll()` method.
Flat buttons are configured with "waves-accent" class whilst raised - with "waves-light".
The color can be changed by adding the `md-waves` attribute as described in this demo.

Default behavior can be changed with `useAutoButtonWaves(mode)` method.
